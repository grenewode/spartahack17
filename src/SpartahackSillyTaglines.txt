Opening:
What are you doing? Open your eyes.
Congrats, bud. You broke space.
You probably just killed everyone... Nice work there.

How you doing? wink
Are you really still playing? I mean... Do you have some friends you could be hanging out with or something?
There is no point. To  this or your life.
Check your phone, I texted you some cheat codes... Made you look.

Death:
Look what you've done. I hope you're happy.
You're honestly probably the worst to play so far.
Nice work.
You really didn't see that coming?

Game over. Try again?
Did you try up-up-down-down-left-right-b-a-start? You seem like you could use a little help.
Think of this as an opportunity to prepare for the inevitable.
(Random did you know facts) – Now at least you learned something.
Want to try easy mode? Well that was easy mode.
